How far in advance should I book the equipment?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
We recommend booking at least 2-3 weeks in advance. However, we can often accommodate last-minute rentals depending on equipment availability.

We offer delivery and setup services for our equipment. Delivery and setup are free for events within the Vacaville, CA area. For events outside of Vacaville, delivery charges and setup fees may apply, 
depending on your location and the complexity of the setup. You can request this service when booking the equipment. Alternatively, you have the option to pick up and return the equipment yourself.
