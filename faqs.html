    Do you provide delivery and setup for your audio equipment?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
    We offer free delivery and setup for our equipment at your event venue within the Vacaville, California area only. We will come and setup the equipment for you and do a demo well before the start time of your event.
    After your event concludes, we will come and remove the equipment. If your event is outside the Vacaville area, you have the option to pick up the equipment from our storage location in Vacaville and return to the same location 
    after use.

<p class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-5 text-body-secondary">
    Do I need to book the equipment in advance?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
    We prefer that you book the equipment package you need at least one week in advance. Sometimes we may be able to cater if you need the equiment right away or the next day, however, this is not always guaranteed. If we are fully 
    booked on your event date then we may let you know. Since we are still growing, sometimes we may add additional inventory to cater for your needs if booked in advanced. For bookings, email us your event date, venue,
    estimated number of attendees and your needs (the package needed, number of microphones, etc) at <strong>bookings@vproaudio.rentals</strong>.

<p class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-5 text-body-secondary">
    What payment methods do you accept?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
    We accept cash (receipts provided) and online payments from our website. Most major credit and debit cards are accepted via our online payment system. Payment is required when signing the lease agreement or 
    when we deliver the equipment at your venue.
