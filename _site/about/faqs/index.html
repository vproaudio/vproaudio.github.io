<p class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-5 text-body-secondary">
How do I make a reservation?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
To rent equipment, simply contact us directly by email <strong>bookings@vproaudio.rentals</strong>. Make sure to include the event dates, equipment needed, delivery or pick-up preferences, and the event location. Include a callback number if you want us to call you back. 
</p>


<p class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-5 text-body-secondary">
How far in advance should I book the equipment?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
We recommend booking at least 2-3 weeks in advance. However, we can often accommodate last-minute rentals depending on equipment availability.
</p>


<p class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-5 text-body-secondary">
Do you deliver and set up the equipment?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
Yes, we offer delivery and setup services for our equipment. Delivery and setup are free if your event is within the Vacaville, CA area. 
Delivery charges and setup fees may apply based on your location (if outside of Vacaville) and the complexity of the setup. You can request this service when booking the equipment.
You also have the option to self pick up and return the equipment.
</p>


<p class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-5 text-body-secondary">
How do I pick up and return the equipment?

What if the equipment is damaged or stops working during my rental?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
If the equipment is malfunctioning or damaged during your rental period, please notify us immediately. Depending on the situation, we will either repair or replace the equipment as quickly as possible. If the damage is due to misuse, you may be responsible for repair or replacement costs.

<p class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-5 text-body-secondary">
Are there any late fees for returning the equipment late?
</p>
<p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
Yes, late returns are subject to additional charges. If the equipment is returned later than the agreed-upon time, you will be charged a late fee, which is usually calculated on a daily basis. Please contact us in advance if you're running late to discuss potential solutions.
