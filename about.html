            We offer clear, upfront pricing so you know exactly what you’re paying for. Our rental equipment is priced per day (24-hour period), 
            ensuring transparency and value. We believe that small businesses and community organizers deserve access to high-quality professional 
            audio for their events at affordable rates.

        <p class="fs-5 fw-bold text-body-secondary">
            Do you provide delivery and setup for your audio equipment?
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
            We offer free delivery and setup for our equipment at your event venue within the Vacaville, California area only. We will come and setup the equipment for you and do a demo well before the start time of your event.
            After your event concludes, we will come and remove the equipment. If your event is outside the Vacaville area, you have the option to pick up the equipment from our storage location in Vacaville and return to the same location 
            after use. 
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-5 text-body-secondary">
            Is a rental agreement required?
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
            Yes, a standard equipment rental agreement is required for renting all equipment from us.  
        </p>
        <!--
        <p class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-5 text-body-secondary">
            Do you offer discounts for long term (multi day) rentals?
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
            Yes, we offer discounts for multi day rentals. Contact us today to find out. 
        </p>
        -->
        <p class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-5 text-body-secondary">
            Do I need to book the equipment in advance?
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
            We prefer that you book the equipment package you need at least one week in advance. Sometimes we may be able to cater if you need the equiment right away or the next day, however, this is not always guaranteed. If we are fully 
            booked on your event date then we may let you know. Since we are still growing, sometimes we may add additional inventory to cater for your needs if booked in advanced. For bookings, email us your event date, venue,
            estimated number of attendees and your needs (the package needed, number of microphones, etc) at bookings@vproaudio.rentals.  
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 fw-bold mt-5 text-body-secondary">
            What payment methods do you accept?
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 text-body-secondary">
            We accept cash (receipts provided) and online payments from our website. Most major credit and debit cards are accepted via our online payment system. Payment is required when signing the lease agreement or 
            when we deliver the equipment at your venue.
