question: "What forms of payment do you accept?"
answer: "Payments can be made through the online payment links in the invoice email we send out once you approve your quotation. We accept all major credit and debit cards, Apple pay, Google Pay and ACH bank transfer. Receipts will be generated automatically and sent to you. We do NOT accept cash payment. Please do not give cash to any of our on-site staff, as they do not have the ability to  provide receipts for payment. "
