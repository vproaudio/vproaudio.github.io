question: "How do I make a reservation?"
answer: "To rent equipment, simply contact us via email (<strong>bookings@vproaudio.rentals</strong>) with the following details: event dates, required equipment, delivery and setup preferences, and event location. If you'd like a call back, please include your phone number. Alternatively, you can send us a message through the <a class='link-opacity-50-hover' href='/about/contact/'>Contact Us</a> page on our website. Once your booking is confirmed, we will send you an online rental agreement to sign, along with a payment link. Payment is due on or before the scheduled date. A valid California ID is required to receive the rental equipment."
